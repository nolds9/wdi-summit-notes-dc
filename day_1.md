# Day 1



On Monday representatives from each instructional team presented an overview of how they present the curriculum in their market. It was a pleasant surprise to see the curriculum moving towards more common goals but still each campus has their own approach and their own personality.

Most of the well-established and successful campuses teach Javascript first, and are mostly following the relative same sequence as the outline from Baseline.

**People are coming to a lot of the same conclusions in terms of curriculum.**

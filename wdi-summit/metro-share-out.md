Metro Share-Out Notes

LDN
*    Initial Baseline Adoption -
*    Second Baseline Adoption - first double cohort in LDN. They then realized they needed to increase the curriculum flexibility.
*    Getting off of the Rails -
*    Node Earlier & More Sinatra -
*    Adding a selection of lessons to support instructor flexibility
*    Still need: more 1:1 time with students, P3 stack is very strange
*    Superpower!: They reflect a lot, they iterate a lot
*    Two days for project 1; intro Node on Wednesday of week 3 (intro to MVC)
*    One or two lessons each unit on testing

NYC
*    Super powers: student support plan (dedicated person to help struggling students), individualized education plan
*    Half days on Wednesdays to break up the week
*    Some cohorts do Express in unit 2, React in unit 3, Ruby in unit 4
*    Project 1 is only two days
*    Unit 2 is PostgreSQL with Express
*    Group project “Shark Tank”
*    Unit 4 Ruby on Rails is self-guided
*    Start final projects in week 11
*   Weekly: 2 exit tickets, quiz, slips

DC
*    Project 1: vanilla JS only (week 3) - week 1 intro to web, week 2 vanilla JS
*    Unit 2 includes jQuery (week 4), Ruby (week 5), Rails (week 6) - project 2 in week 7 - no authentication
*    Unit 3 - Angular and APIs (week 8) - project 3 Angular and Rails (week 9)
*    Unit 4 - Express and MEAN Stack (week 10), PHP intro, SASS, Wordpress, React (week 11) - project 4 (week 12)
*    Slips, homework, bi-weekly 1-on-1s, in-class observations, each instructor has a student “squad”
*    Garnet, GitHub, Slack, HackPad, repotagger.github.io

Chi
* FE JS --> Backend Ruby --> Backend JS --> Client-side JS frameworks
* Had success teaching a week of React
* Afternoon lab times has made accessing student progress more accurate
* Use on campus angular  weekend-workshops to further hone students' learning
* Lessons are "socratic"/interactive/discussion-based
* Superpower is Gitbook; helps with instructor organization & student independence
* Front loaded outcomes programming during the first week, which gave students more time to focus during project weeks

SEA
* FE JS --> Backend JS (w/ SQL) --> Backend Ruby --> Client-side JS
* Staggering 2 cohorts at once has led to faster iteration cycles & flexibility
* Ajax early on exposes students to important concepts more immediately
* Pushed bootstrap to later which has led to better mastery of basic HTML/CSS skills
* Currently teaching sequelize, interested in exploring other tools
* Interesting introducing more React
* Using gitbook & modular repos for notes
* Superpower is lighting-talks; polling students for interest levels in other technologies & having them self-drive the learning process

LA
* FS JS --> Backend Ruby --> Backend JS --> Client-side JS
* Curriculum has been inspired by DC
* Open positions are not as accomidating to junior developers
* Pain-points are: outcomes, small class-sizes (for better or worse), lack of CS focus, amount of content, helping struggling students, grading homeworks & accessments, integrating TDD into lessons
* Superpower is ability to be flexible to the needs of students & Austin market
* Moved away from backbone because not many jobs/too challenging
* Settled on teaching both React & Angular
* Quizes are useful to easily identify struggling students, but then what? As a small market there are not enough to support them
* Looking to impliment Gitbook-style notes

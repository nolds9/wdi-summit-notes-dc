## Overview

The summit went really well, had a great time in Atlanta networking and making friends from other campuses.

Bringing home tons of inspiring stuff, some that could be implemented sooner rather than later, other things which should be on the radar and we can refer to for inspiration as we continue to iterate on the curriculum here in DC.

## Seattle, Austin
Brian Hague and Sean Shannon spoke about ES6 aka ES2015. There was no resolution but it seemed that most people think it's a good idea to introduce as a special topic in support of something like React.js. Special tooling may be necessary due to lack of cross-browser support. React is going to have some transpiling anyway so why not do ES6? Suggested build tools:  Babel, webpack, Gulp

## Remote
Adi Hanash, Matt Huntington and Gordon ____ gave a great presentation on the remote curriculum. They started with red flags and had a failed attempt at a live demo using Cloud9. Despite the technical challenges, we were all impressed that this is going to be cool.

## New York
Jason Seminara spoke about React.js in WDI. Again, there was no resolution, but we think it would be similar to the ES6/2015 question. Most people think it's a good idea to introduce as a special topic.

## Global
Jay Nappy spoke about using Git/GitHub in the classroom. Specifically, copyright issues.
- Teaching trick: Jay made a Gist presentation with 3 prompts: "React to this statement"
- GA is speaking with GitHub about an Enterprise account. We'll see what happens!

## Atlanta
Dr. Mike Hopper spoke about GAlaxy - another website for instructor/student interaction built in the MEAN stack.

## Global
Jeanny spoke to us about Instructor collaborations with Instructional Design.
- What does collaboration look like?
- It seems like they don't have tooling for this but so we need to build our own.
- Highlighted DC's processes as a way to start collaborating without waiting for global

## New York / Global
Jessica Skeete - WDI Vision for the Future
- Other campuses ARE failing students as late as week 6! Global average is 9% failure rate
- We did a SWOT analysis, which was also awesome.

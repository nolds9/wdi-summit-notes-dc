# What's Next?

As a group, we identify some broad pain points shared by all markets: 
> **Problem**: We need a ​_curriculum tracking tool that is used​ to identify what is being taught where and the all relevant data about scope and sequence. 

> **Problem**: We need to gather all our best resources under *one* organization, [ga-wdi-exercises](http://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises) and  [ga-wdi-lessons](http://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons)create standards for new and parallel modules and labs, and adopt a forward-thinking strategy for the curriculum to grow and evolve.

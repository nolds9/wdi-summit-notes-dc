# Day 3 - Wednesday

Wednesday was short and sweet.

## Presentations
### New York
Andrew Madden, the Lead Instructor in NYC used to carry a notecard with him as a reminder of how to set up a great lesson:

* Context
* Specific
* How
* Objectives

He also introduced two useful ways to avoid a codealong:
1. Catch up
2. Screencast

### Boston

Boston is doing a bunch of cool things. One things that stuck out is their philosophy about language. They are firm believes in the power of language and think that is extremely important and frames the entire course. Here are some of our own rewrites of the [language we use](./language.md)

Boston also puts the MIT license and a copyright notice in all their public repos on GitHub. What do you think of [this license](./license.md)

### Global
Jess had a follow-up session in response to her session the previous day.
- "We are not trying to impose one curriculum on everybody."
- There is a need to have a set of modular resources that local instructional teams can influence and selectively poach as needed

### LA, Seattle
